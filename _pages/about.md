I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at Aalborg University working on optimal control, with particular focus on adaptive and dual control. My research covers stochastic state-space modeling, principled learning of dynamical systems with guarantees, and information-aware estimation and control, including active sensing and sensor scheduling. I develop optimization-based methods for decision making under uncertainty, with attention to robustness, uncertainty quantification, and practical implementation. My application interests include robotics and autonomous systems, space and satellite-related problems, and healthcare technologies. In collaboration with Novo Nordisk, I have worked on control methodologies for diabetes treatment and contributed to algorithm implementation supporting clinical evaluation. My publications span different venues in control and machine learning, including IEEE Control Systems Letters, IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology, IFAC World Congress, IEEE CDC, ECC, and ICML.
